A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength, or “loudness”, of a signal over time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform. Not only can one see whether there is more or less energy at, for example, 2 Hz vs 10 Hz, but one can also see how energy levels vary over time.",

If a piezoresistive sensor is applied to an area which produces mechanical motion, the sensor will stretch with the area and also undergo strain. Even a tiny strain will induce a change in the electrical resistance of the sensor, and thus varies the resistance within an electrical circuit. This follows the piezoresistive effect: a change in the electrical activity of a semiconductor or metal occurs when a mechanical strain is applied.",

Free charges eventually return to their original state as the sensor returns towards its original shape, and so oscillating electronic signal is generated when the the sensor vibrates.",
