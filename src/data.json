A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength, or “loudness”, of a signal over time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform. Not only can one see whether there is more or less energy at, for example, 2 Hz vs 10 Hz, but one can also see how energy levels vary over time.",

The piezoresistive sensors show promise in detecting very small vibrations. A major challenge is posed by the natural oscillation of the Adam's Apple on male volunteers.",

Bandpass filters help to eliminate excess noise due to equipment and unwanted neck movements, and generate a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the signal. The FFTs can then be used to generate spectrograms. Future work will look at developing a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the spectrograms.",
